{"name":"Gpsmap","tagline":"A GPSD simulator using a map","body":"gpsmap\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis is a GPSD (http://gpsd.berlios.de/) simulator using a map.\r\n\r\nThis tool is designed for making possible to use Kismet (and other GPSD based\r\ntools) inside buildings, zones without GPS signal, or even without a GPS\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\nThe inner working is simple: you only have to set three reference coordinate\r\npoints on the map using this tool, and the integrated GPSD emulator will start\r\nto send your position coordinates throught the localhost:2947 port.\r\n\r\nThis program can also save a planned route and replay it automatically at a\r\ncertain speed (walk speed parameter).\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/gpsmap-screenshot.jpg \"gpsmap screenshot\")\r\n\r\nQuick start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou will need Python and pyGTK libraries.\r\n\r\nThis program is written for Linux, but it should be work seamlessly on other\r\nUNIX platform. Due it uses sockets it may not work correctly on Windows.\r\n\r\nTo start the program run:\r\n\r\n  python ./gpsmap\r\n\r\nTo start a new project follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Load your image map (JPG, PNG, ...) using the \"Config -> Load map image\"\r\n   menu option.\r\n\r\n2. Go to the \"Config -> Reference points -> Set reference A\". A yellow-cross\r\n   following your mouse will apear on your map.\r\n\r\n   Choose your reference base point (we call it Reference A) and click on it.\r\n   A dialog will appear asking for the geographic coordinates for this point.\r\n   Use some earth map software (like Google Earth) to find them.\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/choose-ref-A-01.jpg \"choosing reference point A\")\r\n\r\n   Once confirmed you will get the following mark on your map:\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/choose-ref-A-02.jpg \"Reference point A set\")\r\n\r\n3. You will need to do this operation two times more. Now we will set the\r\n   horizontal axis reference point (we call it H).\r\n   \r\n   Go to the \"Config -> Reference points -> Set reference H\". This time you\r\n   will get a yellow line with a little cross moving along it. This cross\r\n   will set the position of the H point when you click with your mouse.\r\n\r\n   Once you clicked it will appear a dialog asking for the geographical\r\n   coordinates of this point.\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/choose-ref-H-01.jpg \"choosing reference point H\")\r\n\r\n   Once confirmed you will get the following mark on your map:\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/choose-ref-H-02.jpg \"Reference point H set\")\r\n\r\n4. Repeat this process, but this time with the verical axis setting the\r\n   vertical axis reference point (we call it V).\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/choose-ref-V-01.jpg \"choosing reference point V\")\r\n\r\n   Again you will get a mark on your map:\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/choose-ref-V-02.jpg \"Reference point V set\")\r\n\r\n5. Now gpsmap is fully configured. You can test that it works using the ruler\r\n   (go to \"Edit\" menu, and select \"Ruler mode\"), pressing and dragging the\r\n   mouse left-button over the map:\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/ruler.jpg \"Ruler\")\r\n\r\n   Or testing the precision of your routes saving them with the \"File -> Save KML\r\n   route\" option and loading them in Google Earth maps. If you have set correctly\r\n   the three reference points your route will fit perfectly on the Google Earth\r\n   maps!\r\n\r\n   ![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/route-kml.jpg \"KML route on Google Earth\")\r\n\r\nSending your position\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nTo send a particular position to the software connected to this emulator (i.e.\r\nKismet), you only have to press the mouse left button in the \"No editing mode\".\r\nFor selecting this mode enable the \"Edit -> No editing\" menu option.\r\n\r\nTracing a route\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFor tracing a route you only have to change to the \"Edit route mode\", choosing\r\nthe \"Edit -> Edit route\" menu option. Once you are in the \"Edit route mode\" you\r\nonly have to press the mouse left-button to add new route points:\r\n\r\n![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/route.jpg \"Adding route points\")\r\n\r\nPlease note that if you have running a software that listens to the GPSD port,\r\nit will receive the coordinates of the point you a pressing. You will know\r\nwhich coordinates are being sent throught the GPSD port looking for a pulsating\r\ncircle in your map:\r\n\r\n![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/gps-position.jpg \"GPS position\")\r\n\r\nPlaying a route\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFor playing a route press the \"Animate -> Start\" option menu. It will start\r\nplaying the route while you are moving with your laptop at the same speed:\r\n\r\n![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/walking.jpg \"Walking a route\")\r\n\r\nYou can configure your walking speed in the \"Config -> Set walking speed\":\r\n\r\n![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/walking-speed.jpg \"Walking speed\")\r\n\r\nPlease note that if the \"Animate -> Pause at checkpoints\" option is checked,\r\nthe route will pause automatically each time you reach a control point:\r\n\r\n![gpsmap screenshot](/doc/walking-pause-checkpoint.jpg \"Pause at checkpoint\")\r\n\r\nYou can resume the route hitting the ENTER key. The \"Pause at checkpoints\"\r\noption is useful for resynchronizing your walking with the gpsmap walking :D\r\n\r\nPlease note that the ENTER key is a \"PAUSE/RESUME\" key binding.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
